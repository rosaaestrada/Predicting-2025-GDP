### Based on the provided data and analysis, Denmark will likely experience higher GDP growth rates in 2025 than the USA and Finland.

- The evaluation on the target variable performance for both Logistic Regression and Random Forest the R-squared values for both models are close to 1, indicating that the models explain a high percentage of the variance in the target variable (economic- GDP growth rate)

- This demonstrates strong potential in predicting economic indicators like GDP growth rates.
